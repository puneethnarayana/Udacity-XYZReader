# Udacity-XYZReader
Project 5 of Android NanoDegree

Making the app Material and improvising it's UI and UX

## User Feedback

* This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.
* Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision.
* The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.
